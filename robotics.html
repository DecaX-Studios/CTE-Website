          <h3>Mechanical Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Students explore the principles of mechanics, motion, and machine design. Through 
            hands-on projects, they learn how components like gears, motors, and sensors 
            interact to create efficient robotic systems. The course emphasizes problem-solving, 
            precision, and practical engineering foundations.

          <h3>Programming & Automation</h3>
          <p>
            In this course, students develop the logic and coding skills that bring robots to life. 
            They use programming languages and control systems to automate motion, process data, and 
            integrate feedback. The program nurtures analytical thinking and computational fluency
            essential to modern engineering.

          <h3>Electronics & Control Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Students learn how electrical circuits, sensors, and microcontrollers power robotic devices. 
            They design and test systems that respond to environmental input, focusing on accuracy, 
            calibration, and system reliability. This course builds the bridge between hardware and 
            intelligent automation.

          <h3>Engineering Design & Systems Thinking</h3>
          <p>
            This category challenges students to think like engineers, breaking down problems, designing 
            prototypes, and iterating toward optimal solutions. Emphasis is placed on teamwork, technical 
            documentation, and design methodology that connects mechanical, electrical, and computational 
            disciplines.

          <h3>Competitive Robotics</h3>
          <p>
            Students put their knowledge to the test in team-based robotics competitions. From design and 
            coding to troubleshooting under pressure, they learn adaptability, collaboration, and leadership. 
            Competitions build confidence and connect classroom learning to real-world application.

          <h3>Industry Scholars Program</h3>
          <p>
            The Industry Scholars Program offers students professional experience within STEM and technology 
            fields. Through partnerships with industry mentors and organizations, students apply robotics, 
            coding, and engineering concepts in authentic settings, building both technical proficiency and 
            career readiness.
