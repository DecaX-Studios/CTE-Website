          <p>
            Step into the spotlight and learn the art of performance from script to 
            screen. Students develop confidence, emotional expression, and on-camera 
            presence through scene work, improvisation, and storytelling. Acting 
            cultivates communication, collaboration, and creative discipline, all 
            essential skills for any future in film or theater.

             on set, students learn to guide actors, crews, and creative projects with 
             clarity and purpose. This emphasizes creative decision-making, 
             collaboration, and the craft of visual storytelling.

          <p>
            Behind every great film is a team that brings it to life. In production, 
            students master the technical and organizational aspects of filmmaking.
            From camera operation and lighting to sound design and editing. The focus
            is on teamwork, professionalism, and the ability to adapt under real-world
            production conditions.
